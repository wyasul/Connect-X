Download zip file and unzip it, then run make play. This will prompt you for
some values such as columns and rows to play with, your name, and another
player's name. Right now, we have only implemented two player games (the
idea is that you pass the computer to the other person for each turn).
Once all the data for a game is gathered, it will run the basic game. It will
ask one player to place a chip in a column, then the next player to do so as
well, going back and forth until someone gets "x" in a row either vertically,
diagonally, or horizontally. The game will end once someone wins.
